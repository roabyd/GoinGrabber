# GoinGrabber

This mod replaces the fist bump reward goin at the end of a match with one that can be caught by the player. Players can now slap away the goin, or catch it with the grip button on the controller.

# Installation instructions
- Head over to https://thunderstore.io/c/rumble/p/Roaby/GoinGrabber/ to download the files
- Drag the GoinGrabber.dll file into your Rumble Mods folder
- Drag the goingrabberbundle into your Rumble UserData folder
- Launch Rumble
- Enjoy :)


If you have any ideas on how to add some unique flare to the catch, hit me up, i'm always open to suggestions! Also thank you KaJo for the inspiration to get working on this mod!
